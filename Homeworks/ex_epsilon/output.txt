The real int_max is: 2147483647 
The while loop int_max is: 2147483647
The for loop int_max is: 2147483647
The do while loop int_max is: 2147483647

While loop is: 2.22045e-16 
For loop is: 2.22045e-16 
Do while loop is: 2.22045e-16 
Real epsilon long double is: 1.0842E-19 
While loop is: 1.0842E-19 
For loop is: 1.0842E-19

Exercise 2.i
sum_up_float has value=15.403683
sum_down_float has value=18.807919
Exercise 2.ii
The two functions are mirrors of eachother, so the only difference is		that one starts at max and iterates down and the other opposite.		however we observe a difference which must be attributed to this not being precise
Exercise 2.iii
Yes it converges towards 1.0 because		then all the terms excluding 1.0 are zero
Exercise 2.iv
sum_up_double has value=21.3716
sum_down_double has value=21.3716
We observe a clear difference in the summing of the float		and double. Somehow the float is much more sensitive than		the double.
