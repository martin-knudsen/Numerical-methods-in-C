1.2 The value of the fit coefficients c:
  6.991
  0.990
 -1.996
As one can see the least squares fit is not perfect but reaonably within the errorbars
at least for this example purpose..
C. Testing if the singular value version works.
Using the same function as in 1.2 
The value of the fit coefficients c:
  6.991
  0.990
 -1.996
unbelievable it actually works!
