A. Plain Monte Carlo integration

Integrating dr dphi dtheta r^2 from 0 to 1, 0 to 2pi and 0 to pi
Number of points: 1000000
Result: 6.57841, correct answer is: 6.57974
Error: 0.00588099 

Integrating dx dy dz dq x*y^2*z^3*q^4 from 0 to 1, 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 and 3 to 4
Number of points: 10000000
Result: 2961.31, correct answer is: 2961.29
Error: 0.872235

Integrating dx dy dz (1-cos(x)cos(y)cos(z))^-1/pi^3 from 0 to pi, 0 to pi and 0 to pi
Number of points: 10000000
Result: 1.39322, correct answer is: 1.393204 
Error: 0.00408073

B. Check that error behaves as O(1/âˆšN)

Testing on the first function from previous ex.
Fit coefficient found:5.91521
As one can see on the plot.svg the error follows very nicely
the 1/sqrt(N) prediction. There is of course more uncertainty from that
prediction for low N because here the randomness component of choosing the
points is more important
