The exam problem solved is 'Artificial neural network (ANN) for solving ODE'. 
Solving logistic function
y'=y*(1-y), x∈[-5,5], y(0)=0.5. 
Solving gaussian function
y'=-x*y, x∈[-5,5], y(0)=1. 
Number of hidden neurons for both=6.
Number of points in the interval used for training=25
Activation function is gaussian wavelet for both.
The analytical derivative of the activation function is used.
Now both networks are trained by using my quasi-Newton method
with broyden update implementation from the minimization homework.
For comparison of how well the ANN solves the equations
both the analytical solution found by seperation of variables and the ANN solution
for 100 points in the interval are found.
This is plotted in plot_log.svg and plot_gauss.svg respectively.
As on can see the solutions are approximated very well with exception of
the ends of the intervals.
