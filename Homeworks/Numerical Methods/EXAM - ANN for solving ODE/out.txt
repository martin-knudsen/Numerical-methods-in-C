A. Testing the ANN on the function I used in the interpolant exercise
Testing if linear spline works. 
Testfunction is cos(x) from 0 to 2pi. 
Plot can be seen in plot.svg 
B. Testing the ANN on 2D interpolation of Rosenbrock function
Plot can be seen in plot2.svg 
Number of hidden neurons: 25
To find good starting values or the weights they were found from a previous training run
As one can see from the plot it seems to capture the trend but not exactly the function value 
For more training points more neurons, smaller epsilon and better start conditions might be required
For plot2 there was used 441 points, and on plot2_121_points there was used 121 points
