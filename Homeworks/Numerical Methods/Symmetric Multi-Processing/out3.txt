Testing if cspline spline works. 
Testfunction is cos(x) from 0 to 2pi. 
Data for plotting the cspline is found in cdata.txt 
Integral of cos(x) from 0 to pi/2 is 1 analytically 
Using cubic splines I get 1.0293
The theoretical derivative at point pi/2 is -1
Using cubic splines I get -0.996897 
I have plottet the result from gsl and my cspline in csplinetest.pdf
This is the derivative result at pi/2 from GSL: -0.997859
This is the integral result at pi/2 from GSL: 0.9937
