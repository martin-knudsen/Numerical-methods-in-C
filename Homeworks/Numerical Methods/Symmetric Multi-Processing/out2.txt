Testing if qspline spline works. 
Testfunction is cos(x) from 0 to 2pi. 
Data for plotting the qspline is found in qdata.txt 
Integral of cos(x) from 0 to pi/2 is 1 analytically 
Using qaudric splines I get 1.00045
The theoretical derivative at point pi/2 is -1
Using quadric splines I get -0.983609 
Testing that all the coefficients calculated manually are the same
As I get using the spline program
The result of the test is: 
True
