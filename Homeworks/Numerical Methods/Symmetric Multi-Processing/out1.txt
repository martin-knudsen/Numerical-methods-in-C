Testing if linear spline works. 
Testfunction is cos(x) from 0 to 2pi. 
Data for plotting the linearspline is found in lineardata.txt 
Integral of cos(x) from 0 to pi/2 is 1 analytically 
Using linear splines I get 0.968093
The theoretical derivative at point pi/2 is -1
Using linear splines I get -0.983609
